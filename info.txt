Phase Labelling. 
Next the phase must be labeled in the data, as this
will be an input parameter for the PFNN. This can be performed by
a semi-automatic procedure. Firstly, foot contact times are automatically labeled by computing the magnitude of the velocity of the heel
and toe joints and observing when these velocities go below some
threshold [Lee et al. 2002]. Since this heuristic can occasionally fail,
the results are manually checked and corrected by hand. Once these
contact times are acquired the phase can be automatically computed
by observing the frames at which the right foot comes in contact
with the ground and assigning a phase of 0, observing the frames
when the left foot comes in contact with the ground and assigning a phase of p, and observing when the next right foot contact
happens and assigning a phase of 2p. These are then interpolated
for the inbetween frames. For standing motions some minimum
cycle duration (~0.25s) is used and the phase is allowed to cycle
continuously
